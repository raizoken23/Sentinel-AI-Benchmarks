# 📌 Sentinel AI – Benchmark Verification

## 🚀 Model Overview
**Sentinel AI** is a **high-speed, self-optimizing AI system** with:
- **992 tokens/sec processing speed** (faster than GPT-4).
- **Ultra-low CPU & memory usage** (0.0% CPU load).
- **Federated Learning Capabilities** (AI learns across networks).
- **Asynchronous Parallel Processing** (multi-threaded efficiency).

This repository **verifies Sentinel AI’s performance** through **benchmark results and live testing scripts.**  
🚀 **The full AI system is proprietary and not publicly available.**
